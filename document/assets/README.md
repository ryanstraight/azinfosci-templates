# Document Template Assets

This template does not require logo files by default. The document template focuses on content styling rather than letterhead branding.

If you wish to add a logo to your documents, you can place image files here and reference them in your Quarto document.

## Optional Files

| Filename | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `infosci-logo.png` | (Optional) Logo for document header |

## Obtaining Logos

See the main package README or `inst/assets/logos/README.md` for instructions on obtaining official UA College of Information Science logos.
